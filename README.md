Chapters 1, 2, and 10 contain stand-alone snippets of python and SQL for code examples. For all other chapters, we have provided notebooks in the [db-notebooks](https://github.com/benniehaelen/delta-lake-up-and-running/tree/main/db-notebooks) folder along with instructions in the [README](https://github.com/benniehaelen/delta-lake-up-and-running/blob/main/db-notebooks/README.md) on how to get set up.
